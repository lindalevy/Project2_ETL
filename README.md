# Project2_ETL

Finding Data

Your project must use 2 or more sources of data. We recommend the following sites to use as sources of data:

* [data.world](https://data.world/)

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

You can also use APIs or data scraped from the web. However, get approval from your instructor first. Again, there is only a week to complete this!

## Data Cleanup & Analysis

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that you will extract from.

* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).

* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.

## Project Report

At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:

* **E**xtract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

* **T**ransform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

* **L**oad: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.

Please upload the report to Github and submit a link to Bootcampspot.
